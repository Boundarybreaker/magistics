**_Adding some logistics to Thaumcraft!_**

## Workspace Setup
Luckily most of this has been taken care of! Simply run one of the scripts contained in the "scripts" directory (that's catered to your OS) from the project's root directory and you should be all set!

## Contributing
1. Fork it
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "My awesome change!"`)
3. Create a new pull request

### Parameters
All that I ask when making a new pull request is that none of the project's formatting be affected. Yes, I'm very hypocritical when outlining this, but the way that my IDE formats things is just what I prefer. Any other format tends to look disorganized, particularly when blended w/ other formats. Code isn't ment to just be functional; it's meant to look good too!
