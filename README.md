**_Adding some logistics to Thaumcraft!_**

## Workspace Setup
Luckily most of this has been taken care of! Simply run one of the scripts contained in the "scripts" directory (that's catered to your OS) from the project's root directory and you should be all set!

## Contributing
1. Fork it
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "My awesome change!"`)
3. Create a new pull request

### Parameters
All that I ask when making a new pull request is that none of the project's general formatting be affected. This is so that other formats do not conflict w/ what is existing, and avoids giant blocks of highlighted code in Git commits. Also, it's generally because it has a great appearance! Code isn't meant to just be functional; it's meant to look good too!
